*Non-Bootstrap Version*
- [X] Copy the contents of Basic-Portfolio (your first homework solution) and paste the mentioned files into Responsive-Portfolio.
Note: Be sure not to include any dot files (e.g. .git, .gitignore) from the Basic-Portfolio repo.
- [X] If you chose the Wireframe exercise for your first homework assignment, talk to a TA, who will provide you with a template for your portfolio.
- [X] Inside your Responsive-Portfolio folder, find your styles.css file. You will write your media queries at the bottom of styles.css.
- [ ] Use three @media screen tags, each with one of these max-widths: 980px, 768px and 640px.
- [ ] Make the layout match the following screenshots:
    * index.html: 980px, 768px, 640px
    * portfolio.html: 980px, 768px, 640px
    * contact.html: 980px, 768px, 640px
- [ ] Make the position of the header static (the default positioning) when the screen is 640px wide. The header design takes up a lot of room; you don't want it to stick to the top of a small screen and leave no room for the rest of your site.
- [ ] Be sure to include the viewport tag in all your HTML files, otherwise your media-queries won't function as expected on mobile devices. (Hint: You won't need to use exact pixels for anything other than the container).
- [ ] Deploy your new portfolio (now with media queries!) to GitHub Pages.

**BONUS**
- [ ] Incorporate CSS animations in your portfolio.
